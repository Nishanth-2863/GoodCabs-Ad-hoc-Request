# 🚗 Resume Project Challenge 13: Delivering Operational Insights for Goodcabs  

## 📋 Problem Statement  
Goodcabs, a cab service company focusing on tier-2 cities in India, has set ambitious performance targets for 2024. To help drive growth and improve passenger satisfaction, the Chief of Operations needed insights into:  

- **Trip Volumes & Distribution**: Understanding how trips are distributed across cities and time periods.
- **Passenger Satisfaction Metrics**: Analyzing feedback from passengers and drivers to evaluate service quality.
- **Repeat Passenger Behavior**: Investigating how often repeat passengers use the service and identifying trends.

This project involved delivering these insights through advanced SQL queries, helping Goodcabs make data-driven decisions to optimize their operations.

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **MySQL**: The core tool for analyzing and querying data from the `trips_db` and `targets_db` databases.

## 🔍 Applied SQL Concepts  
This project leverages a range of SQL techniques to provide deep insights into Goodcabs' operations:  
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** 
- **Window Functions** 
- **Subqueries**
- **Aggregate Functions**
- **Joins**

  
## 🚀 Key Deliverables  
1. **Trip Volume Analysis**: Identified trends in trip volumes and distribution across various cities  
2. **Repeat Passenger Behavior**: Analyzed the number of repeat trips and patterns, providing insight into customer loyalty and retention.


## Key Insights
1.Jaipur, Lucknow, and Surat contribute the highest percentage to the overall trip volume, with Jaipur leading at 18.05%, followed by Lucknow at 15.10%, and Surat at 12.88%, highlighting the significant role of these cities in driving the company's trip volume."

2.Despite contributing 12.88% to total trip volume, Surat ranks in the bottom 3 for new passengers, highlighting a need to improve customer acquisition

3.Mysore exhibits the lowest city-wide repeat passenger rate at 11.23%, indicating a significant gap in retaining repeat passengers compared to other cities.
